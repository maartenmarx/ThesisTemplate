# Template for Master Thesis Design Information Science

### Abstract/Purpose
You use this   template for your thesis design document. You keep the main sections and stick to the overall setup.
The template is [available in LaTeX](https://github.com/maartenmarx/ThesisTemplate/blob/master/ThesisTemplate/ThesisDesign.tex) too.  Below the template you find the form which supervisors use to assess your thesis design.

<!--Below is also a template for the  presentation of your thesis design. -->

### ACM template on overleaf

* You can find the ACM template also on overleaf. You can then use the points below for the content.

### Thesis design template

Based on  <https://wiki.cs.vu.nl/mp/index.php/Information_Sciences_Master#Thesis_design>

The goal of a thesis design is to write a research proposal on the subject of your chosen master project. The research proposal   consists of the following content:

1. A title, supervisor(s) and abstract
	* Plus clickable links to email addressess of author, supervisors and **private** github repository of the thesis project.
2. A clearly defined research problem and corresponding subquestions
3. Overview of the state of the art of the literature
	* Clearly indicate how your approach is grounded in the literature
5. Methodology
	* Describe your "resources" (those that are applicable)
		* data
		* algorithms
		* software
	* Describe the methods you will use
	* Describe how you evaluate your results.
    	* Each project must finish with a quantitative evaluation. This can be done with A/B testing or using a gold standard evaluation set containing human-assigned correct labels or scores.  In case A/B testing is chosen, an elaborate risk assessment and a plan B must be present. Evaluation must be in such a way that it is possible to state that a proposed solution works **significantly** better than some baseline.
5. Risk assessment
	* Describe the risks, an describe your backup plan for each of them.
3. Project plan 
	*  You describe what you have achieved when. 
	* This typically has the shape of a table with 12 entries (one for each week).
	* The last entry is clear (Thesis).
	* Other entries refer always back to your subquestions, methodology, literature.
	* You describe concrete achievements, not actions. (e.g., instead of _data preparation_ you write _all data in XXX format, well-described, ready for analysis using YYY_)


**Please note that the advised maximum length for the thesis design  is 4 pages using the provided LaTeX template.**
The rationale for this is that you should see this thesis design as an elevator pitch in which you want  to **quickly** convince a great supervisor that you are a great student. Great supervisors will get many requests and have little time. They will probably select students which can be brief, succinct, to the point and with crystal clear plans. That is why short is recommended.

##### Thesis template (in Dutch)
You find a thesis template containing some nice tricks (e.g., about creating LaTeX tables in pandas and adding your presentation slides as an appendix in <https://github.com/maartenmarx/ThesisTemplate>)

### Thesis Design assessment form

<!--You can receive 100 points for your thesis design. Your grade is the number of points divided by 10.-->
 Below you see the weight of each section and the questions used by the supervisor to assess the sections. 

1. A title, supervisor(s), abstract **(10)**
	 * _Is all clear and neat?_
2. A clearly defined research problem and corresponding subquestions **(20)**
	* Can the problem be answered?
	* Do answers to the subquestions indeed help in an understanding of the research problem or even in solving the research problem?
	* Are the subquestions detailed enough?
3. Overview of the state of the art of the literature **(20)**
	* One expects that the research problem is grounded in the literature and that each subquestion or field has a small section of relevant literature.
	* All parts of the thesis should be grounded in or at least connected to  the literature.
4. Methodology **(20)**
	* Do I get a clear picture of the used resources?
		* E.g., for data, do I get a clear picture of the data, its state, its availability, how much it is, how dirty, how much work to process, etc, etc.
	* Are the methods which will be used described in enough detail, so that I can picture what will be done exactly? 
	* Is the evaluation appropriate? That is, do I understand how each subquestion is answered by the evaluation? 
5. Risk assessment **(10)**
	* Is it complete? Is is realistic? Is the backup plan executable?
6. Project plan  **(20)**
	* Is it complete? (I.e., every part of the work covered.)
	* Is it realistic?
	* Does it give a clear picture of what will be done when? 
	* Is it possible to evaluate whether the student is on schedule at any point in time?
